* v0.1.0 UI change

  - In Monikop, "Files To Copy" switches from ratio to percentage if
    the former grows too wide. This happened with tens of thousands
    of files.

* Bug fix v0.0.1

  - After stopping monikop by power cut and putting the removable
    disks into pokinom, with sufficient amount of bad luck monikop
    would have re-copied data unnecessarily.

* Initial release v0.0.0 

  - All tests pass.

  - We release a tarball on ohloh.net (where the release process is
    scriptable).

  - Monikop and Pokinom show their version number.
